This is an extremely hacky experiment to try to run SmallWorld in JavaScript.
It is uses [TeaVM](http://teavm.org) to translate the bytecode into JavaScript.
Surprisingly, it was possible to get the command REPL version of SmallWorld
working in a Web browser with few modifications.

This code is currently extrmely rough I used the standard TeaVM maven archetype
to create the fake smallworld.js package and entry point in
src/main/java/smallworld/js/Client.java.

If you run

```bash
# Build the SmallWorld jar, used by TeaVM
$ ./gradlew jar

$ cd experimental
$ mvn package
```

This will create a war file, but you can simply run a Web server from
`target/js-1.0-SNAPSHOT`. The `index.html` in that directory will run the
SmallWorld text version and the doIt will appear in the javascript console.

The trickiest bit was loading the image, which was hacked around by making an
XMLHttpRequest to fetch the image, and read it using a ByteArrayInputStream.
