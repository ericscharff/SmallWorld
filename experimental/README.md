This directory used to contain a very hacky experimental version of SmallWorld
that used [TeaVM](http://teavm.org) to translate the Java bytecode into
JavaScript. This code somewhat worked, but was very incomplete. In the meantime,
I have created an alternative implementation of SmallWorld. In
[smallworld.js](https://github.com/ericscharff/smallworld.js) I rewrote
SmallWorld directly in JavaScript, including a port of the GUI to HTML.
